2000-04-25  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: podlators 1.02 released.

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm (sequence): Pass a special flag to collapse() for
	C<> blocks rather than trying to fix up hyphens and underscores.
	(collapse): Fix hyphens and underscores for literal C<> block
	content.

2000-04-09  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm (sequence): Fix hyphens and underscores in only
	those children of a C<> sequence that haven't already had
	guesswork applied to them.

2000-03-30  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: podlators 1.01 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Install the modules in the Perl core area if the
	Perl version is 5.6.0 or higher.

2000-03-18  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm (begin_pod): Strip a leading lib/ from a file
	name for module man pages, needed for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

2000-03-16  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: podlators 1.00 released.

	* Makefile.PL: pod2roff renamed to pod2man.

	* lib/Pod/Text.pm: Use a static version number, add the remaining
	ISO 8859-1 HTML entities (from Tim Jenness).

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm (protect): Be even more aggressive; protect any
	line starting with a backslash.
	(cmd_item): Replace embedded newlines in titles with spaces.

	* scripts/pod2man.PL: Hide '-' arguments from Getopt::Long so that
	Pod::Parser will interpret them as STDIN or STDOUT.  Remove
	needless use vars.
	* scripts/pod2text.PL: Likewise.

	* scripts/pod2text.PL: Don't default to Pod::Text::Termcap even if
	STDOUT is a tty until it works right on Windows, VMS, etc.

	* scripts/pod2man.PL: Change Getopt::Long config from bundling to
	bundling_override so that options like -center work for backwards
	compatibility.

2000-03-07  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* scripts/pod2man.PL: Change pod2txt to pod2man in SYNOPSIS.

2000-03-06  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* scripts/pod2man.PL: Renamed from pod2roff.PL as this has been
	incorporated in Perl core.  Updated self-references in the
	documentation, changed "stati" to "statuses."

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm: Set version number to 1.00, change references to
	pod2roff to pod2man in the documentation, and remove the note about
	this module replacing pod2man in Perl core.

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm (initialize): Use "perl v5.6.0" instead of "perl
	5.6, patch 0" for the default release string, handle both pre-5.6
	and post-5.6 version numbering schemes.
	(protect): Allow for two-character fonts.
	(begin_pod): Zero-pad the month and day in the modification date.
	(sequence): Add a temporary variable for L<> text rather than
	blessing the sub return to work around a 5.6 bug.
	(guesswork): $3 no longer used in small-caps regex, remove to
	avoid warnings under -w.

2000-03-05  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm (protect): Protect leading periods following font
	escapes as well.
	(initialize): Avoid warnings when center, date, or release aren't
	set.
	(begin_pod): Make filename munging safe even when $* is set and
	the filenames contain embedded newlines.
	(textblock): Use a temporary variable for paragraph text, fix the
	regex to concatenate multiple L<> section links and fix whitespace
	handling for it around "and".
	(sequence): Add a temporary variable workaround so that Z<> works
	correctly with current Perl.
	(cmd_for): Don't extract the line number when we don't use it.

1999-10-07  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: podlators 0.08 released.

	* lib/Pod/Text.pm: Export pod2text() for backwards compatibility.

	* lib/Pod/Text.pm (interior_sequence): Add support for numeric E<>
	escapes.
	* lib/Pod/Man.pm (sequence): Likewise.

1999-09-27  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm (buildlink): Links to sections had doubled quote
	marks.

	* scripts/pod2roff.PL: Pod::Parser constructors take an expanded
	hash, not a hash ref.

1999-09-25  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: podlators 0.07 released.

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm: Changed the parsing model so that rather than
	deferring E<> escapes until just before output, *roff output is
	generated by the interior sequence parsing and the result is
	passed up the parse trees as Pod::Man::String objects instead of
	scalars to mark the output as already processed.  In the process,
	cleaned up what *roff escaping and guesswork is applied where and
	cleaned up the whole process of applying guesswork.  Also improved
	the small caps guesswork to allow for more cases, including
	several adjacent all caps words, and fixed some bugs with the link
	text generation for man page references.  Improved the escaping of
	dashes and hyphens to use a single pass, improved the index
	generation slightly, and fixed a few places that were clobbering
	the caller's $_.

1999-09-20  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: podlators 0.06 released.

	* scripts/pod2roff.PL: Expanded the man page documentation to take
	into account suggestions from Larry Virden.  Added examples for
	ENVIRONMENT, more examples for OPTIONS, better examples for
	subsections in DESCRIPTION, more details on ERRORS, a plea for a
	method of fixing problems in DIAGNOSTICS as well as what the
	message means, a plea for an explanation of examples in EXAMPLES,
	a plea for documenting files that are modified in FILES, a mention
	of a program web site in SEE ALSO, a mention of e-mail addresses
	in AUTHORS, the AVAILABILITY section, and a note about markup
	including L<> issues with e-mail addresses and URLs.

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm: Added a BUGS entry for index entries for stuff
	in NAME.

	* lib/Pod/Text.pm: =begin text blocks are now output verbatim
	rather than interpreted as POD.  Documented the oddity with
	Ctrl-As as a restriction.

	* Makefile.PL: pod2txt renamed to pod2text.

	* scripts/pod2roff.PL: Exit on Getopt::Long errors.

	* scripts/pod2text.PL: Renamed to pod2text and updated for the
	renaming of Pod::PlainText to Pod::Text.  Added an explicit check
	for Term::ANSIColor if -c was given.  Added documentation of -h,
	expanded the DIAGNOSTICS section to include directly generated
	error messages and the most common Getopt::Long message.

	* lib/Pod/Text/Termcap.pm: Updated for the renaming of
	Pod::PlainText to Pod::Text.

	* lib/Pod/Text/Color.pm: Updated for the renaming of
	Pod::PlainText to Pod::Text, added BUGS note that the
	implementation is rather incomplete and a note in DESCRIPTION that
	it relies on Term::ANSIColor.

	* lib/Pod/Text.pm: Renamed to Pod::Text, various comment cleanups,
	always treat =for paragraphs as verbatim text, cleaned up the
	documentation a little, and added two more diagnostics and a
	cross-reference to pod2text(1).  Bumped revision to 2.0 to be
	larger than the old Pod::Text.

	* lib/Pod/Man.pm: Renamed to Pod::Man from Pod::Roff, since there
	is no standard Pod::Man module to worry about conflicting with.

	* scripts/pod2roff.PL: Cut down on some information redundant with
	Pod::Man's documentation, changed for the renaming of Pod::Roff to
	Pod::Man, and added a BUGS section noting a few currently unfixed
	problems.

	* lib/Pod/Roff.pm: Inherit from Pod::Parser instead of
	Pod::Select, get the date from our input file by default, be even
	more conservative about small caps but put AT&T in small caps, and
	added documentation.

	* Makefile.PL: Add pod2roff to the scripts, improve handling of
	scripts a little.

1999-09-19  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* lib/Pod/Roff.pm: New file.
	scripts/pod2roff.PL: New file.

	in one final spot in the documentation.

1999-08-30  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: podlators 0.04 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Use File::Spec to build file paths for portability,
	removed the dist setting since current Perls get this right, and
	added the magic to cope with pod2txt as a .PL file.

	* scripts/pod2txt.PL: Added the .PL magic to fix the shebang line
	that will be necessary when this script is part of Perl core.

	* VERSION: podlators 0.03 released.

	* lib/Pod/Text/Color.pm: Pod::SimpleText changed to Pod::PlainText
	everywhere.
	lib/Pod/Text/Termcap.pm: Likewise.

	* scripts/pod2txt: Pod::SimpleText changed to Pod::PlainText
	everywhere, added documentation that Pod::Text::Termcap is used by
	default if STDOUT is a tty, and clarified the documentation of
	--loose.

1999-07-29  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: podlators 0.02 released.

	* lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Added a pod2text() function for backwards
	compatibility.

	using Pod::PlainText.
	lib/Pod/Text/Color.pm: Likewise.

	* lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Properly wrap multi-line =item tags.

	* Makefile.PL: Changed the name of the package to podlators.

	* lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Fixed a spurious space with =for text
	commands, check the content of sequences against '' specifically
	rather than testing truth so that it does the right thing with 0,
	process sequences for =head headings, and changed the name from
	SimpleText to PlainText.  Also speeded up some sequences slightly.
