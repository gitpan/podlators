        * lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Added a pod2text() function for backwards
        compatibility.

        * lib/Pod/Text/Termcap.pm: Switch from using Pod::SimpleText to
        using Pod::PlainText.
        lib/Pod/Text/Color.pm: Likewise.

        * lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Properly wrap multi-line =item tags.

        * Makefile.PL: Changed the name of the package to podlators.

        * lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Fixed a spurious space with =for text
        commands, check the content of sequences against '' specifically
        rather than testing truth so that it does the right thing with 0,
        process sequences for =head headings, and changed the name from
        SimpleText to PlainText.  Also speeded up some sequences slightly.
