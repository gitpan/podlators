Sat Sep 25 12:49:54 1999  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION: podlators 0.07 released.

        * lib/Pod/Man.pm: Changed the parsing model so that rather than
        deferring E<> escapes until just before output, *roff output is
        generated by the interior sequence parsing and the result is
        passed up the parse trees as Pod::Man::String objects instead of
        scalars to mark the output as already processed.  In the process,
        cleaned up what *roff escaping and guesswork is applied where and
        cleaned up the whole process of applying guesswork.  Also improved
        the small caps guesswork to allow for more cases, including
        several adjacent all caps words, and fixed some bugs with the link
        text generation for man page references.  Improved the escaping of
        dashes and hyphens to use a single pass, improved the index
        generation slightly, and fixed a few places that were clobbering
        the caller's $_.

Mon Sep 20 00:55:29 1999  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION: podlators 0.06 released.

        * scripts/pod2roff.PL: Expanded the man page documentation to take
        into account suggestions from Larry Virden.  Added examples for
        ENVIRONMENT, more examples for OPTIONS, better examples for
        subsections in DESCRIPTION, more details on ERRORS, a plea for a
        method of fixing problems in DIAGNOSTICS as well as what the
        message means, a plea for an explanation of examples in EXAMPLES,
        a plea for documenting files that are modified in FILES, a mention
        of a program web site in SEE ALSO, a mention of e-mail addresses
        in AUTHORS, the AVAILABILITY section, and a note about markup
        including L<> issues with e-mail addresses and URLs.

        * lib/Pod/Man.pm: Added a BUGS entry for index entries for stuff
        in NAME.

        * lib/Pod/Text.pm: =begin text blocks are now output verbatim
        rather than interpreted as POD.  Documented the oddity with
        Ctrl-As as a restriction.

        * Makefile.PL: pod2txt renamed to pod2text.

        * scripts/pod2roff.PL: Exit on Getopt::Long errors.

        * scripts/pod2text.PL: Renamed to pod2text and updated for the
        renaming of Pod::PlainText to Pod::Text.  Added an explicit check
        for Term::ANSIColor if -c was given.  Added documentation of -h,
        expanded the DIAGNOSTICS section to include directly generated
        error messages and the most common Getopt::Long message.

        * lib/Pod/Text/Termcap.pm: Updated for the renaming of
        Pod::PlainText to Pod::Text.

        * lib/Pod/Text/Color.pm: Updated for the renaming of
        Pod::PlainText to Pod::Text, added BUGS note that the
        implementation is rather incomplete and a note in DESCRIPTION that
        it relies on Term::ANSIColor.

        * lib/Pod/Text.pm: Renamed to Pod::Text, various comment cleanups,
        always treat =for paragraphs as verbatim text, cleaned up the
        documentation a little, and added two more diagnostics and a
        cross-reference to pod2text(1).  Bumped revision to 2.0 to be
        larger than the old Pod::Text.

        * lib/Pod/Man.pm: Renamed to Pod::Man from Pod::Roff, since there
        is no standard Pod::Man module to worry about conflicting with.

        * scripts/pod2roff.PL: Cut down on some information redundant with
        Pod::Man's documentation, changed for the renaming of Pod::Roff to
        Pod::Man, and added a BUGS section noting a few currently unfixed
        problems.

        * lib/Pod/Roff.pm: Inherit from Pod::Parser instead of
        Pod::Select, get the date from our input file by default, be even
        more conservative about small caps but put AT&T in small caps, and
        added documentation.

        * Makefile.PL: Add pod2roff to the scripts, improve handling of
        scripts a little.

        * VERSION: podlators 0.05 released.

        * lib/Pod/Text/Color.pm: Pod::SimpleText changed to Pod::PlainText
        in one final spot in the documentation.

Mon Aug 30 00:09:03 1999  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION: podlators 0.04 released.

        * Makefile.PL: Use File::Spec to build file paths for portability,
        removed the dist setting since current Perls get this right, and
        added the magic to cope with pod2txt as a .PL file.

        * scripts/pod2txt.PL: Added the .PL magic to fix the shebang line
        that will be necessary when this script is part of Perl core.

        * VERSION: podlators 0.03 released.

        * lib/Pod/Text/Color.pm: Pod::SimpleText changed to Pod::PlainText
        everywhere.
        lib/Pod/Text/Termcap.pm: Likewise.

        * scripts/pod2txt: Pod::SimpleText changed to Pod::PlainText
        everywhere, added documentation that Pod::Text::Termcap is used by
        default if STDOUT is a tty, and clarified the documentation of
        --loose.

Thu Jul 29 08:23:09 1999  Russ Allbery  <eagle@windlord.stanford.edu>

        * VERSION: podlators 0.02 released.

        * lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Added a pod2text() function for backwards
        compatibility.

        * lib/Pod/Text/Termcap.pm: Switch from using Pod::SimpleText to
        using Pod::PlainText.
        lib/Pod/Text/Color.pm: Likewise.

        * lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Properly wrap multi-line =item tags.

        * Makefile.PL: Changed the name of the package to podlators.

        * lib/Pod/PlainText.pm: Fixed a spurious space with =for text
        commands, check the content of sequences against '' specifically
        rather than testing truth so that it does the right thing with 0,
        process sequences for =head headings, and changed the name from
        SimpleText to PlainText.  Also speeded up some sequences slightly.
